This is the official repository for Haigieia Health Helper's web application. Haigieia Health Helper is a health tracking app that streamlines the process of adding food and water to your diet using conversational AI. 

We use a Next.js frontend and a ExpressJS backend for the app. Our conversational AI dialogue tree is powered by the Jaseci platform. Check out the frontend and backend folders for more details.
